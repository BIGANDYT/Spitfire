      Value: |
        Purchase credit cards can help you spread the cost of big-ticket items or keep all your spending together in one place. They can be used to manage your household expenses more efficiently or to pay for a family holiday. And with a choice of low interest rates or ways to earn rewards when you use your card, a purchase credit card from MBNA could be just what you&rsquo;re looking for.<br />
        <br />
        You also get extra protection when shopping in store or over the internet with a purchase credit card. As with all credit cards transactions of between &pound;100 and &pound;30,000 are covered by Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act if something you buy is faulty, you don&rsquo;t receive them or if the company stops trading. Using a debit card or using cash might not give you this level of protection.
