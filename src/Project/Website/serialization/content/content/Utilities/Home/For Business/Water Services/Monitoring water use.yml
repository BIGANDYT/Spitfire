        <h1>Monitoring water use</h1>
        <p><img alt="" width="250" height="167" class="align-right" src="https://www.affinitywater.co.uk//images/Business/consumption-logger.jpg" style="float: right;">Water and energy efficiency are now a key part of commercial and government responsibility. Minimising use of water and applying sustainable solutions are key activities towards responsible management of resources.</p>
        <p>Knowing when, where and how you&rsquo;re using water can give you the information to understand how you can improve efficiency.</p>
        <p>Water consumption loggers take the guesswork out of high water consumption and will map your water usage, any misuse of water and, of course, <a href="leakage-detection.aspx">water leakage</a>. Loggers can help you identify where you can make savings and give you a picture of your supply performance.</p>
        <p>Our consumption loggers record continually, allowing you to view daily consumption rates via the internet and act quickly if consumption increases unexpectedly. Loggers give you the ability to collect data 24/7, helping to evaluate the efficiency of a particular system by providing accurate information.</p>
        <p>By helping you to identify any leaks, dripping taps or over-usage at an early stage, the loggers could give you considerable long-term cost savings.</p>
        <p>We can install loggers on main and sub-meters, allowing you to isolate usage, for example, by building, process or tenant.</p>
        <h3>Water Saving Devices</h3>
        <p>We also advise, supply, fit and service a range of water efficiency products to reduce your consumption. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Push on/off taps</li>
            <li>Aerated shower heads</li>
            <li>Sensor and low-water urinals</li>
            <li>Urinal control valves</li>
            <li>Low-flush devices for larger toilet cisterns</li>
