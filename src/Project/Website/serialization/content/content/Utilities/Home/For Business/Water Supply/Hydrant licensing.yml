        <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>Our Hydrant Team can help if you need to draw water from a hydrant in any of the three regions in our network area.</p>
        <h3>What area is covered by the Affinity Water network.</h3>
        <p>You can see the area we cover by clicking on this link <a target="_blank" href="our-supply-area-moving-home.aspx">Our Supply Area</a>.</p>
        <h3>Who is allowed to take water from an Affinity Water hydrant?</h3>
        <p>Only holders of an Affinity Water issued licence may draw from our network.&nbsp; It is an offence under section 174 of the Water Industry Act 1991 to draw water without permission and legal proceedings may be taken against Illegal users.&nbsp; Illegal use increases the risk of contamination to our network on the public water supply, reduction in pressure, or even a mains failure.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>How long will it take to process my application?</h3>
        <p>We require between 7 to 10 days for your licence to be processed fully.&nbsp; Please note applications cannot be fast tracked.</p>
        <h3>What type of licence do I need?</h3>
        <p>We can offer an Annual Hydrant licence or a Short Term Hydrant licence.&nbsp; You will need a licence for each standpipe you wish to use.</p>
        <p><strong>An annual licence -&nbsp;</strong>provides access to over 280 pre-selected washout points throughout the Affinity Water (Central region) network.&nbsp; This option allows companies to fill up and transport water short distances to the required site.&nbsp; Companies licensed to use the Washout list must adhere to the points on the list.&nbsp; Licences run from the 1st April to 31st&nbsp;March&nbsp;the following&nbsp;year, though customers can apply at any time.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>A Short Term licence - </strong>allows customers to specify which particular hydrant they wish to access over any period of time shorter than a year.&nbsp; This option is more suited to companies who are working on a specific site.&nbsp; Please note not all hydrants are suitable for use and the hydrant would be checked before and after use by one of our Technicians.&nbsp; <strong>Please allow up to 10 days for your licence to be processed fully.</strong></p>
        <p>Please note it is against our Terms and Conditions to access any hydrant point other than those listed on the licence, and such usage will be subject to an&nbsp;Unauthorised Use charge and possible legal proceedings taken.</p>
        <h3>How do I become a hydrant licence holder?</h3>
