        <h1>Welcome to our Developer Services information page</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>*IMPORTANT NOTICE*</strong></span></p>
        <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Christmas and New Year Streetworks Embargoes</span></h2>
        <p>Leading up to and over the Christmas and New Year period, many local authorities place an embargo on work being done in streets and areas around busy shopping centres and town centres. This means it may not be possible for us to undertake any new connections work. When you are ready for a connection, please <a href="https://www.affinitywater.co.uk/developer-services-get-in-touch.aspx">contact us</a> so we can check any embargoes in your area and agree an installation date with you.</p>
        <p>We are sorry for any inconvenience this causes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Please also note that an application fee has been introduced&nbsp;which will also be required with your application form and supporting documentation. For further information please visit <a target="_blank" href="/developer-services-FAQ.aspx">our FAQs</a>.</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Developer Services Team is responsible for providing new water mains, new water service connections, and the upgrade and/or separation of existing water supplies.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless of whether you are building a new house, extending your existing home, separating an existing water supply, building&nbsp;commercial property&nbsp;or industrial developments, or a new housing development, we will manage your application from first contact through to the completion of connection.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">On these pages you&rsquo;ll find a range of information, guidance notes and application forms for upgrading of supplies, extension of mains, and temporary connections to our mains. If you need to check that your development is in our area, please click the link <a target="_blank" href="/our-supply-area-moving-home.aspx">Our Supply Area</a>.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We will also provide guidance on <a href="self-lay-information.aspx">Self-Lay schemes&nbsp;</a>and <a href="business-services.aspx">private water mains connection</a>.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">PLEASE DO NOT undertake any construction works on your side of the property boundary until you have discussed&nbsp;your connection requirements with the Developer Services Team.&nbsp; This will help to prevent delays to your application and any unforeseen costs or further construction works should the wrong pipe be installed or the wrong route followed.</p>

        <h2>Application Fees</h2>
        <p>Please note:&nbsp;All charges, application fees and infrastructure charges,&nbsp;are subject to change from April 2015.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Section 45 (Adhoc) application fee is &pound;201.48 + VAT (Total charge = &pound;241.78) from 1st April 2015.</li>
            <li>The Section 41 (mains) application fee is &pound;495.35 + VAT (Total charge = &pound;594.43) from 1st April 2015.</li>
            <li>Mains budget application fees are &pound;250.00 + VAT (Total Charge = &pound;300.00)</li>
            <li>Adhoc budgets are available for free and will shortly be available using an online tool. This will subsequently be extended to high level Mains budgets too.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Infrastructure Charges Increase</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Please be aware that as of <strong>1<sup>st</sup> April 2015</strong>, infrastructure charges will increase to &pound;351.00.&nbsp; You have to pay infrastructure charges on top of the cost of connecting a property to the water main and/or wastewater system (provided by Anglian Water or Thames Water depending on your location within our area).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Each company can raise infrastructure charges for connecting premises for household purposes to a public water main or to a public sewer for the first time.&nbsp; Ofwat set an upper limit on this charge.&nbsp; At the 2004 price review, the maximum infrastructure charge was set at &pound;260.15 for each service for 2005-06, to be indexed subsequently each year in line with inflation (November RPI).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Further information can be found in our <a target="_blank" href="/docs/ChargesSchemes-2015-2016.pdf">Charges Scheme</a> and on the website of our regulator, <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150624091829/https://www.ofwat.gov.uk/regulating/newconnections/charging#infrastructure">Ofwat</a>.</p>
